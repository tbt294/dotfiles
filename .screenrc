# For screen's copy-mode (C-a ESC), I prefer to use my muscle-memoried keys:
#
#   v (to enter 'visual selection'
#   y (to yank it)
#
# In screen's case, they both map to the old SPACE behavior,
# since SPACE is used to mark the beginning AND place the
# current selection in the paste buffer.
#
# After this, just paste: C-a ]
