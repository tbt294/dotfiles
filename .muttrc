# Speaking of mbsync ...
# These are the settings I used in .mbsyncrc:

# # IMAPAccount      gmail
# # Host             imap.gmail.com
# # User             ttsiodras@gmail.com
# # Pass             PASSWORD
# # UseIMAPS         yes
#
# # # The following 3 certificates were fetched via openssl:
# # #
# # #   bash$ openssl s_client -connect imap.gmail.com:993
# # #
# # # and I then saved the BEGIN/END sections in the two certificate files.
# # #
# # # Since GMail signed them with Equifax, I pointed to that as
# # # well - and made sure I run "c_rehash" under ~/.cert
# # # (thus creating symlinks from their hashes under there)
# #
# # CertificateFile  ~/.cert/google.pem
# # CertificateFile  ~/.cert/imap.gmail.com.pem
# # CertificateFile  /etc/ssl/certs/Equifax_Secure_CA.pem
# #

# # Account    gmail

# # MaildirStore  gmail-local
# # Path          ~/mail/
# # Inbox         ~/mail/AllMail

# # Channel   gmail
# # Master    :gmail-remote:
# # Slave     :gmail-local:
# # Create    Slave
# # Expunge   Slave
# # Sync      PullNew PullDelete
# # Patterns  "[Gmail]/All Mail"
